Machine learning algorithms are widely implemented in python,
and can be directly used within data science project. However, it is important for any serious data scientist to get a good comprehension on the behind of these python black-box.

In the scope of this project, I undertake the passionate task to implement some of the most common ML algorithms from scracth.
